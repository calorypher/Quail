# M17 Results — Search Engine Performance

## Outcome

M17 removes the measured interactive-search bottlenecks without changing the
filesystem schema, build/sync lifecycle, ranking implementation, source-neutral
Core/FileSystem direction, installer, or maintenance behavior.

For one- and two-character literal substring queries, `IndexStore` now reads a
bounded four-times-result-limit candidate set in stable SQLite `rowid` order and
applies the existing final ranking and result limit. This avoids repeated full
table scans and candidate-expansion sorts on the short-query path. The existing
trigram path and its candidate-expansion behavior remain unchanged for queries
of three or more characters.

The temporary one-second short-query defer is now zero. `LatestSearchCoordinator`
also reuses an already-running identical query for the latest UI generation,
which removes the measured duplicate synchronous Core search rather than adding
another queue or scheduler. Different queries retain the existing latest-wins
pending-work behavior.

## Final physical-host campaign

The canonical M16 harness ran once with all eight scenarios and three
repetitions on commit `fa66270461f8f4461fd574c490a82ad214dcad39` with a clean
worktree. The host had .NET SDK `10.0.400`, Windows `10.0.26200.0`, two active
indexes, 858,879 records, and 273,358,848 database bytes. The compact,
non-sensitive samples are committed in `docs/milestones/M17-baseline.json`.
The ignored raw traces remain under `artifacts/m17/final-fa66270/`.

| Scenario | Samples (ms) | Median (ms) | Target / guardrail | Result |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `ordinary-name` | 21.865, 16.439, 21.628 | 21.628 | <= 50 / <= 100 | PASS |
| `strong-prefix` | 18.427, 17.149, 15.426 | 17.149 | <= 50 / <= 100 | PASS |
| `broad-result` | 135.741, 136.219, 139.119 | 136.219 | <= 150 / <= 250 | PASS |
| `one-character` | 39.891, 41.092, 40.867 | 40.867 | <= 150 / <= 250 | PASS |
| `two-character` | 43.410, 41.082, 47.259 | 43.410 | <= 150 / <= 250 | PASS |
| `warm-repeated` | 60.807, 60.667, 60.177 | 60.667 | <= 100 / <= 150 | PASS |
| `fresh-process-first-search` | 89.961, 88.056, 87.328 | 88.056 | <= 125 / <= 150 | PASS |
| `rapid-typing` final | 56.422, 58.381, 55.676 | 56.422 | <= 75 / <= 125 | PASS |
| `rapid-typing` burst | 538.225, 538.309, 525.437 | 538.225 | <= 600 / <= 700 | PASS |

`broad-result` Core median was 126.547 ms with zero measured queue wait.
`warm-repeated` Core median was 47.755 ms with zero measured queue wait. The
short-query Core medians were 33.528 ms (`one-character`) and 33.573 ms
(`two-character`), with zero measured queue wait.

## Focused verification

| Area | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Short-query correctness | PASS | Literal case-insensitive matching, filters, bounded limit, and deterministic repeated short-query output remain covered by focused `FileSearchTests`. |
| Ranking and multi-index ordering | PASS | Existing focused ranking and multi-index tests passed; final ranking and merge comparers were not changed. |
| Duplicate-query scheduling | PASS | The focused coordinator test proves one running identical Core search serves the latest UI generation, while the existing stale-result, invalidation, bounded-pending, lane, and disposal tests remain green. |
| Focused automated suite | PASS | `dotnet test tests\\Quail.Core.Tests\\Quail.Core.Tests.csproj --configuration Release --filter "FullyQualifiedName~FileSearchTests|FullyQualifiedName~FileSearchRankingTests|FullyQualifiedName~MultiIndexSearchTests|FullyQualifiedName~M13BSearchSchedulingTests|FullyQualifiedName~M11SearchCoordinatorTests|FullyQualifiedName~M12IndexCatalogTests|FullyQualifiedName~SearchPerformanceTraceTests|FullyQualifiedName~M11ShortQueryDeferrerTests"` — 57 passed. |
| Affected Release build | PASS | The final canonical harness rebuilt `Quail.App`, `Quail.Core`, and `Quail.FileSystem` in Release with zero warnings and zero errors before the 8x3 campaign. |

No bounded multi-index concurrency was added: the local candidate and duplicate
query changes met every target, so the measured evidence did not justify extra
parallelism or a scheduler framework.

## Scope and remaining handoff

No schema/index redesign, rebuild work, ranking v2, maintenance work, package
work, or generic scheduler was introduced. Search actions and path resolution
are unchanged; existing action/open coverage remains applicable. A short
user-owned Quick Search smoke for result opening remains useful before merge,
but installer, Quail-Lab, and historical architecture campaigns were correctly
not repeated.
